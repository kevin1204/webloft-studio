    projectOverview: "Flowga Yoga Studio needed a complete website transformation to better showcase their yoga and wellness services.

      "No online booking system integration for easy class scheduling",
      "Poor search engine visibility for local yoga classes in Toronto",
      "Lack of clear pricing and class information for potential students"
    ],
    solutions: [
      "Designed a modern, calming interface that reflects wellness values and brand identity",
      "Implemented mobile-first responsive design optimized for all devices",
      "Created an intuitive online booking system with real-time class availability",
      "Optimized for local SEO with Toronto-specific keywords and location targeting",
