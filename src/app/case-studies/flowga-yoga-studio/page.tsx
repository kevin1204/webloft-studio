    projectOverview: "Flowga Yoga Studio needed a complete website transformation to better showcase their yoga and wellness services.

      "No online booking system integration for easy class scheduling",
      "Poor search engine visibility for local yoga classes in Toronto",
      "Lack of clear pricing and class information for potential students"
    ],
