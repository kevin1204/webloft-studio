              Your website is often the first impression potential clients have of your business. Unfortunately, many businesses unknowingly make critical mistakes that drive visitors away before they even consider becoming customers. <strong>Here are the 5 most common website mistakes that could be costing you clients right now.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              1. Slow Loading Speed
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              <strong>53% of visitors will leave a website that takes longer than 3 seconds to load</strong>. In today's fast-paced digital world, people expect instant results. If your website is slow, potential clients will simply go to your competitors.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Common causes of slow loading include large images, too many plugins, unoptimized code, and poor hosting. The solution? Optimize images, use a content delivery network (CDN), choose quality hosting, and regularly audit your site's performance.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              2. Poor Mobile Experience
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              <strong>Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices</strong>, yet many websites still provide a poor mobile experience. If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you're losing more than half of your potential clients.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Mobile-friendly means more than just responsive design. It means fast loading, easy navigation, readable text, and touch-friendly buttons. Test your website on actual mobile devices, not just desktop browsers.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              3. Unclear Value Proposition
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Visitors should understand <strong>what you do and why they should choose you within 5 seconds</strong> of landing on your homepage. If your value proposition is unclear, confusing, or buried, visitors will leave before they understand your offering.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Your homepage should immediately answer: What do you do? Who do you serve? What makes you different? Use clear headlines, benefit-focused copy, and compelling calls-to-action to guide visitors toward conversion.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              4. Weak or Missing Calls-to-Action
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              <strong>Every page should have a clear next step for visitors</strong>. Without strong calls-to-action (CTAs), you're essentially inviting people to your store but not telling them what to do once they're there.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Effective CTAs are specific, action-oriented, and visually prominent. Instead of generic "Learn More" buttons, use "Get Your Free Consultation" or "Start Your Project Today." Make it clear what happens when they click.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              5. Outdated or Unprofessional Design
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              <strong>Your website's design directly impacts your credibility</strong>. An outdated, cluttered, or unprofessional design makes visitors question your business's legitimacy and competence. First impressions matter, and your website is often the first impression.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Modern design principles include clean layouts, plenty of white space, consistent branding, high-quality images, and intuitive navigation. Your website should look as professional as your business is.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              The Hidden Cost of These Mistakes
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              These mistakes don't just cost you visitors—they cost you <strong>qualified leads, potential revenue, and business growth</strong>. Every visitor who leaves due to these issues is a potential client you'll never get back.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              The good news? These are all fixable problems. With the right approach, you can transform your website from a liability into your most powerful business tool.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">
              How to Fix These Issues
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Start by auditing your current website for these common mistakes. Test your loading speed, check mobile responsiveness, review your value proposition, analyze your CTAs, and evaluate your design's professionalism.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              <strong>Consider working with web professionals</strong> who can identify and fix these issues quickly and effectively. The investment in a professional website often pays for itself through increased conversions and client acquisition.
