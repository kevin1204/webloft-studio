              Many business owners view their website as just another expense. But here's the truth: <strong>a great website is one of the best investments you can make for your business</strong>. Let's break down the real numbers and see why.

              The Numbers Don't Lie: Real ROI Examples
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Consider this: A well-designed website can increase your conversion rate by <strong>200-300%</strong>. That means if you're currently converting 1% of your visitors, a professional site could boost that to 3-4%. For a business getting 1,000 visitors per month, that's the difference between 10 customers and 30-40 customers.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-6 my-8">
              <p className="text-gray-700 font-medium">
                <strong>Real Example:</strong> One of our clients, a local contracting company, saw their lead generation increase by 180% within 3 months of launching their new website. Their monthly revenue increased by $15,000.
              </p>

              Trust & Credibility: The Hidden Value
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Your website is often the first impression potential customers have of your business. A <strong>professional, modern website builds instant trust and credibility</strong>. Studies show that 75% of users judge a company's credibility based on their website design.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              Think about it: Would you trust a business with an outdated, poorly designed website? Neither would your potential customers. A great website positions you as professional, reliable, and trustworthy.

              Lead Generation: Your 24/7 Salesperson
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Unlike traditional advertising that stops working when you stop paying, a great website works around the clock. It's your <strong>24/7 salesperson</strong> that never takes a day off, never gets sick, and never asks for a raise.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              With proper SEO and lead capture forms, your website can generate qualified leads even while you sleep. This consistent lead flow is invaluable for business growth and stability.

              Cost Comparison: Website vs Traditional Marketing
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Let's compare the costs:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 mb-8">
              <li><strong>Website (one-time investment):</strong> $3,000 - $10,000</li>
              <li><strong>Monthly maintenance:</strong> $200 - $500</li>
              <li><strong>Traditional advertising (monthly):</strong> $2,000 - $5,000</li>
              <li><strong>Print marketing (monthly):</strong> $1,000 - $3,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              A website pays for itself quickly and continues generating value for years. Traditional marketing stops working the moment you stop paying.

              Competitive Advantage
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              In today's digital world, not having a professional website puts you at a significant disadvantage. Your competitors are likely already online, capturing customers who are searching for your services.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              A great website levels the playing field and can even give you an edge over larger competitors who might have outdated or poorly designed sites.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              Unlike many business investments, a website provides <strong>measurable, trackable results</strong>. You can see exactly how many visitors you're getting, where they're coming from, and how many are converting into customers.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              A great website isn't an expense—it's an investment in your business's future. It builds trust, generates leads, provides competitive advantage, and delivers measurable returns.
